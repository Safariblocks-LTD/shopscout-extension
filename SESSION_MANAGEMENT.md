## ✅ Implementation Complete

ShopScout now has **secure, persistent session management** with excellent UX!

---

## 🔄 Authentication Flow

### First-Time User (Magic Link)

```
1. User opens extension
   ↓
2. Sees auth screen with owl mascot
   ↓
3. Enters email address
   ↓
4. Clicks "Send Magic Link"
   ↓
5. Success message: "Check your email"
   ↓
6. User checks inbox (1-2 minutes)
   ↓
7. Clicks link in email
   ↓
8. Firebase authenticates user
   ↓
9. ✅ Session established (stored locally)
   ↓
10. Main app appears with user profile at top
```

**Time**: ~2-3 minutes (one-time only)

---

### Returning User (Automatic)

```
1. User opens extension
   ↓
2. Firebase checks local storage
   ↓
3. Valid session found
   ↓
4. ✅ User automatically signed in
   ↓
5. Main app appears immediately
```

**Time**: < 1 second (instant!)

---

## 🔒 Session Persistence

### Browser Local Persistence

**Implementation:**
```typescript
setPersistence(auth, browserLocalPersistence)
```

**What This Means:**
- ✅ Session persists across browser restarts
- ✅ Session persists across extension reloads
- ✅ Session persists across tab closes
- ✅ User stays signed in indefinitely

**Storage Location:**
- Chrome's local storage (encrypted)
- Managed by Firebase
- Secure token storage

---

## 🎯 When Users Need to Re-Authenticate

Users only need to sign in again if:

1. **Explicit Sign-Out**
   - User clicks the sign-out button
   - Session is cleared immediately

2. **Token Revoked**
   - User revokes access in Firebase Console
   - Admin revokes user's token
   - Security breach detected

3. **Session Expired** (Rare)
   - Refresh token expires (60 days of inactivity)
   - Firebase automatically refreshes tokens

4. **Browser Data Cleared**
   - User clears browser data/cache
   - Extension is uninstalled and reinstalled

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Firebase Configuration
```typescript
// Set persistence to LOCAL (default, but explicit)
setPersistence(auth, browserLocalPersistence)
```

### Session Restoration
```typescript
// Automatic on app load
onAuthStateChanged(auth, (user) => {
  if (user) {
    // User is signed in, session restored
    setUser(user);
  } else {
    // No session, show auth screen
    setUser(null);
  }
});
```

### Magic Link Completion
```typescript
// Check if URL contains magic link
if (isSignInWithEmailLink(auth, window.location.href)) {
  // Complete sign-in
  await signInWithEmailLink(auth, email, window.location.href);
  // Session automatically established
}
```

---

## 📱 User Data Available

After authentication, you have access to:

```typescript
user.uid           // Unique user ID
user.email         // User's email address
user.displayName   // Display name (may be null)
user.photoURL      // Profile photo URL (may be null)
user.emailVerified // Email verification status
user.metadata      // Creation/last sign-in times
```

---

## 🎯 Session Lifecycle

### Session Creation
1. User completes Magic Link authentication
2. Firebase creates session
3. Token stored in local storage
4. `onAuthStateChanged` fires with user object
5. App updates to show main content

### Session Maintenance
1. Firebase automatically refreshes tokens
2. No user interaction needed
3. Works silently in background
4. Tokens valid for 60 days

### Session Termination
1. User clicks sign-out
2. Firebase clears session
3. Local storage cleared
4. `onAuthStateChanged` fires with null
5. App shows auth screen
