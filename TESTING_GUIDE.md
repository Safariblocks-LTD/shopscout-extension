- Must be on actual product page (not search results)
- URL should contain `/dp/` for Amazon

**Check 2: Is content script loaded?**
```javascript
// In console, type:
console.log('Content script loaded:', typeof ProductScraper !== 'undefined');
```
- Should return `true`
- If `false`, refresh the page

**Check 3: Check console logs**
- Look for `[ShopScout]` messages
- Should see "Initializing scraper..."
- Should see "Product page detected"

---

### If Sidebar Shows Empty State

**Possible Causes**:
1. Not on a product page ‚Üí Navigate to product page
2. Content script not loaded ‚Üí Refresh the page
3. Product scraping failed ‚Üí Check console for errors

**Solution**:
1. Refresh the Amazon page
2. Wait for automatic detection (2-3 seconds)
3. Click extension icon again

### If Price History Shows Mock Data

**This is normal!**
