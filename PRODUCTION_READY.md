# ShopScout Extension - Production Ready ✅

## Overview
Your ShopScout extension has been successfully configured for production deployment to the Chrome Web Store. All localhost references have been replaced with production URLs.

## Changes Made

### 1. **AuthPrompt.tsx** ✅
- **Before**: Hardcoded `http://localhost:8000`
- **After**: Uses `API_CONFIG.AUTH_URL` from config
- **Result**: Opens `https://shopscout-auth.fly.dev` when users click "Open Authentication Page"

### 2. **public/auth.js** ✅
- **Before**: Hardcoded `http://localhost:3001` for backend sync
- **After**: Uses `https://shopscout-api.fly.dev`
- **Result**: User authentication syncs to production backend

### 3. **WelcomeScreen.tsx** ✅
- **Before**: Hardcoded `http://localhost:3001` for user creation
- **After**: Uses `https://shopscout-api.fly.dev`
- **Result**: New user profiles are created on production backend

### 4. **config.js** ✅
- **Before**: Environment detection logic that could fail
- **After**: Always uses production URLs:
  - `BACKEND_URL: 'https://shopscout-api.fly.dev'`
  - `AUTH_URL: 'https://shopscout-auth.fly.dev'`
- **Result**: Consistent production URLs across all builds

### 5. **manifest.json** ✅
- **Before**: Included `http://localhost:*/*` in host_permissions
- **After**: Removed localhost permission
- **Result**: Clean production manifest ready for Chrome Web Store

### 6. **TypeScript Support** ✅
- Created `config.d.ts` for proper TypeScript type definitions
- **Result**: No more TypeScript errors when importing config

## Production URLs

| Service | URL |
|---------|-----|
| **Backend API** | `https://shopscout-api.fly.dev` |
| **Auth Server** | `https://shopscout-auth.fly.dev` |
| **Firebase** | `shopscout-9bb63.firebaseapp.com` |

## Files Already Production-Ready

These files were already configured correctly:
- ✅ `src/services/api.ts` - Has `USE_PRODUCTION = true`
- ✅ `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` - Has `USE_PRODUCTION = true`
- ✅ `background.js` - No localhost references

## Build Instructions

### 1. Build the Extension
```bash
npm run build
```

This will:
- Compile TypeScript files
- Bundle React components
- Copy auth files to dist
- Create production-ready extension in `dist/` folder

### 2. Load Extension in Chrome

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" (toggle in top-right)
3. Click "Load unpacked"
4. Select the `dist/` folder from your project
5. The extension will load with production URLs

### 3. Test the Extension

1. **Click the extension icon** - Opens the side panel
2. **Click "Open Authentication Page"** - Should open `https://shopscout-auth.fly.dev`
3. **Sign in with Google or Magic Link** - Authentication happens on production
4. **Verify backend sync** - User data syncs to `https://shopscout-api.fly.dev`

## Chrome Web Store Submission Checklist

- ✅ All localhost references removed
- ✅ Production URLs configured
- ✅ Extension builds successfully
- ✅ Manifest.json is production-ready
- ✅ Firebase authentication configured
- ✅ Backend API deployed and accessible
- ✅ Auth server deployed and accessible

### Additional Requirements for Chrome Web Store

Before submitting, ensure you have:

1. **Extension Assets**
   - [ ] High-quality screenshots (1280x800 or 640x400)
   - [ ] Promotional images (440x280)
   - [ ] Extension icon (128x128)
   - [ ] Detailed description

2. **Privacy & Security**
   - [ ] Privacy policy URL (required for extensions that handle user data)
   - [ ] Terms of service
   - [ ] Data usage disclosure

3. **Testing**
   - [ ] Test on fresh Chrome profile
   - [ ] Test authentication flow end-to-end
   - [ ] Test on different shopping sites
   - [ ] Verify all features work with production URLs

## Verification Commands

### Check for any remaining localhost references:
```bash
# Search in source files
grep -r "localhost" src/ --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" --include="*.js"

# Search in config files
grep -r "localhost" *.js *.json *.ts
```

### Verify production URLs are present:
```bash
grep -r "shopscout-api.fly.dev" src/ config.js
grep -r "shopscout-auth.fly.dev" src/ config.js
```

## Troubleshooting

### If auth page still opens localhost:
1. Clear browser cache
2. Rebuild extension: `npm run build`
3. Remove and reload extension in `chrome://extensions/`

### If backend sync fails:
1. Verify backend is running: `curl https://shopscout-api.fly.dev/health`
2. Check browser console for CORS errors
3. Verify Firebase configuration

### If TypeScript errors appear:
1. Run `npm run type-check`
2. Ensure `config.d.ts` exists in project root
3. Restart TypeScript server in your IDE

## Next Steps

1. **Test thoroughly** - Load the extension and test all features
2. **Create promotional materials** - Screenshots, descriptions, etc.
3. **Prepare privacy policy** - Required for Chrome Web Store
4. **Submit to Chrome Web Store** - Follow the submission process
5. **Monitor after launch** - Check for errors and user feedback

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify backend services are running
- Review Firebase authentication logs
- Check network tab for failed API calls
