# ‚úÖ Deployment Complete - ShopScout Authentication Fix

## Deployment Summary

**Date**: October 12, 2025  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Successfully Deployed

---

## What Was Fixed

### 1. Auth Server Backend URL
- **Issue**: Auth page was using `http://localhost:3001` instead of production URL
- **Fix**: Updated to `https://shopscout-api.fly.dev`
- **File**: `auth-server/public/auth.js` (line 98)

### 2. Auth Data Persistence
- **Issue**: Auth data was cleared too quickly, causing extension to miss it
- **Fix**: Extended validity to 60 seconds with 5-second delayed clearing
- **File**: `auth-server/server.js` (lines 58-73)

### 3. Background Script Polling
- **Issue**: Insufficient logging and error handling
- **Fix**: Added comprehensive logging, storage verification, and better error handling
- **File**: `background.js` (lines 710-831)

### 4. Sidebar Authentication Detection
- **Issue**: No visibility into auth check process
- **Fix**: Added detailed logging for debugging
- **File**: `src/App.tsx` (lines 31-68)

2. Find ShopScout extension
3. Click "service worker" link (blue text)
4. Look for these logs:

```
[ShopScout] üéâ Authentication detected from web page!
[ShopScout] User: your-email@example.com
[ShopScout] Auth method: google
[ShopScout] ‚úÖ User data stored successfully in chrome.storage.local
[ShopScout] Storage verification: {authenticated: true, userId: "...", userEmail: "..."}
```

### Check Sidebar Console

3. Look for these logs:

```
[ShopScout Sidebar] Starting authentication check...
[ShopScout Sidebar] Auth check result: {authenticated: true, ...}
[ShopScout Sidebar] ‚úÖ User authenticated: your-email@example.com
```

### Verify Storage
In the background service worker console, run:
```javascript
chrome.storage.local.get(null, (data) => console.log('All storage:', data));
```

Should show:
```javascript
{
  authenticated: true,
  userId: "firebase-uid-here",
  userEmail: "your-email@example.com",
  displayName: "Your Name",
  photoURL: "...",
  emailVerified: true,
  authMethod: "google",
  authTimestamp: 1234567890,
  firebaseUser: {...}
}

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Sidebar Still Shows "Authentication Required"

**Solution 1**: Wait a bit longer (up to 10 seconds)
- The polling happens every 2 seconds
- May take a few cycles to sync

**Solution 2**: Check browser console for errors
- Look at background service worker console
- Look at sidebar console
- Check for any red error messages

**Solution 3**: Manually refresh
- Close and reopen the sidebar
- Click the extension icon again

**Solution 4**: Clear storage and retry
```javascript
// In background service worker console:
chrome.storage.local.clear();
// Then re-authenticate
```

### Issue: Auth Tab Doesn't Close

This is normal behavior and not a problem:
- Authentication is still successful
- Manually close the auth tab
- Click the extension icon to open sidebar
- Sidebar should show your profile

### Issue: CORS Errors

If you see CORS errors in console:
1. Verify auth server is running: 
   ```bash
   /home/kcelestinomaria/.fly/bin/flyctl status -a shopscout-auth
   ```
2. Check auth server logs:
   ```bash
   /home/kcelestinomaria/.fly/bin/flyctl logs -a shopscout-auth
   ```
3. Redeploy if needed:
   ```bash
   cd auth-server
   /home/kcelestinomaria/.fly/bin/flyctl deploy
   ```
