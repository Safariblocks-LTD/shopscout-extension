# ðŸ”§ Authentication Troubleshooting Guide

## Issue Fixed: `auth/internal-error` with Google Sign-In

### Problem
The `signInWithPopup()` method doesn't work reliably in Chrome extension context, causing `auth/internal-error`.

### Solution Applied
Changed from `signInWithPopup()` to `signInWithRedirect()` which works better in extensions.

### What Was Changed
- Updated `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Now uses `signInWithRedirect()` instead of `signInWithPopup()`
- Added `getRedirectResult()` handler to process the redirect callback

---

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Reload the Extension
```
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Find ShopScout
3. Click the ðŸ”„ Reload button
```

### 2. Test Google Sign-In
```
1. Click ShopScout icon
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. You'll be redirected to Google's sign-in page
4. Select your Google account
5. You'll be redirected back to the extension
6. âœ… You should be signed in!
```

## Common Firebase Auth Errors

### `auth/internal-error`
**Cause**: Usually popup-based auth in extension context  
**Solution**: âœ… Fixed by using redirect method

### `auth/unauthorized-domain`
**Cause**: Extension domain not in Firebase authorized domains  
**Solution**:
1. Go to Firebase Console
2. Authentication â†’ Settings â†’ Authorized domains
3. Add: `chrome-extension://[YOUR_EXTENSION_ID]`
4. Also add: `[YOUR_EXTENSION_ID].chromiumapp.org`

### `auth/popup-blocked`
**Cause**: Browser blocking popup windows  
**Solution**: Not applicable anymore (we use redirect now)

### `auth/operation-not-allowed`
**Cause**: Google provider not enabled in Firebase  
**Solution**:
1. Firebase Console â†’ Authentication â†’ Sign-in method
2. Enable Google provider
3. Save changes

### `auth/invalid-api-key`
**Cause**: Wrong API key in firebase config  
**Solution**: Verify `src/config/firebase.ts` has correct credentials

## Verification Checklist

After reloading the extension, verify:

- [ ] Extension reloaded successfully
- [ ] No console errors on extension load
- [ ] Auth screen appears
- [ ] "Continue with Google" button works
- [ ] Redirects to Google sign-in page
- [ ] After signing in, redirects back to extension
- [ ] User is authenticated
- [ ] Main app content appears
- [ ] Sign-out button works

## Alternative: Use Magic Link Instead

If Google Sign-In still has issues, use Magic Link:

1. Click "Sign in with Magic Link"
2. Enter your email
3. Check your email inbox
4. Click the link
5. âœ… Signed in!

Magic Link is more reliable in extension context.

## Debug Mode

To see detailed error messages:

1. Right-click extension icon â†’ Inspect
2. Go to Console tab
3. Try signing in again
4. Check for error messages
5. Share the error if you need help

## Firebase Console Checklist

Ensure these are configured:

### Authentication â†’ Sign-in method
- [x] Google provider: **Enabled**
- [x] Email/Password: **Enabled**
- [x] Email link (passwordless): **Checked**

### Authentication â†’ Settings â†’ Authorized domains
- [x] `localhost`
- [x] `shopscout-9bb63.firebaseapp.com`
- [x] `chrome-extension://[YOUR_EXTENSION_ID]`
- [x] `[YOUR_EXTENSION_ID].chromiumapp.org`

### Google Cloud Console (if using Google Sign-In)
- [x] OAuth consent screen configured
- [x] Test users added (if in testing mode)

---

## Still Having Issues?

### Check Browser Console
```javascript
// Open DevTools on extension
// Look for these errors:
- "Firebase: Error (auth/...)"
- "Chrome runtime error"
- Network errors
```

### Verify Firebase Config
```typescript
// src/config/firebase.ts should have:
const firebaseConfig = {
  apiKey: "AIzaSyCrApKcweIjfoaKCPh3IRqTAMyTi65KdG0",
  authDomain: "shopscout-9bb63.firebaseapp.com",
  projectId: "shopscout-9bb63",
  // ... rest of config
};
```

### Check Manifest Permissions
```json
// manifest.json should have:
{
  "permissions": ["identity", "storage"],
  "host_permissions": [
    "https://*.googleapis.com/*",
    "https://*.firebaseapp.com/*",
    "https://*.google.com/*"
  ]
}
```

## Next Steps

1. **Reload extension** with the fix
2. **Test Google Sign-In** (should work now with redirect)
3. **Test Magic Link** (as backup)
4. **Verify session persistence** (close/reopen extension)

The redirect method is more reliable for Chrome extensions! ðŸš€
