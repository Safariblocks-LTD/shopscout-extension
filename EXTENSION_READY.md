# ✅ EXTENSION FIXED AND READY

## All Issues Resolved

### 1. ✅ Icon Path Issue - FIXED
- **Problem**: Manifest referenced `assets/icon16.png` but files were in `assets/icons/`
- **Fix**: Updated manifest to `assets/icons/icon16.png`
- **Fix**: Updated build script to copy icons directory recursively
- **Result**: All icon files now in `dist/assets/icons/`

### 2. ✅ Service Worker API Issue - FIXED
- **Problem**: Used `clients.matchAll()` which crashes in Chrome extensions
- **Fix**: Replaced with `chrome.runtime.getContexts()`
- **Result**: Service worker loads properly

### 3. ✅ Module Type Issue - FIXED
- **Problem**: Manifest declared `"type": "module"` but background.js wasn't a module
- **Fix**: Removed `"type": "module"` from manifest
- **Result**: Background script loads correctly

### 4. ✅ Production URLs - CONFIGURED
- All localhost references replaced with production URLs
- Auth: `https://shopscout-auth.fly.dev`
- API: `https://shopscout-api.fly.dev`
