# Authentication Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

Your extension was stuck on "Authentication Required" after signing in because:

1. **Hardcoded Localhost URLs**: The auth page (`auth-server/public/auth.js`) was trying to sync user data to `http://localhost:3001` instead of the production backend URL `https://shopscout-api.fly.dev`

2. **Auth Data Cleared Too Quickly**: The auth server was clearing authentication data immediately after the first poll, causing the extension's background script to miss it

3. **Insufficient Logging**: Made it difficult to diagnose where the authentication flow was failing

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Production URLs in Auth Page
**File**: `/auth-server/public/auth.js`

```javascript
// Before (Line 96):
const response = await fetch('http://localhost:3001/api/user/sync', {

// After:
const BACKEND_URL = 'https://shopscout-api.fly.dev';
const response = await fetch(`${BACKEND_URL}/api/user/sync`, {
```

### 2. Improved Auth Data Persistence
**File**: `/auth-server/server.js`

- Extended auth data validity from 30 seconds to 60 seconds
- Delayed clearing auth data for 5 seconds after first read
- Allows multiple polls to succeed, ensuring the extension picks up the authentication

### 3. Enhanced Background Script Polling
**File**: `/background.js`

- Added comprehensive logging for debugging
- Added storage verification after saving user data
- Added 500ms delay for storage sync
- Improved error handling
- Better sidebar opening logic with multiple fallback approaches

### 4. Better Sidebar Authentication Detection
**File**: `/src/App.tsx`

- Added detailed logging for auth checks
- Better fallback for display name
- Clearer console messages for debugging

## Authentication Flow (Fixed)

```
1. User clicks extension icon
   â†“
2. Sidebar opens showing "Authentication Required"
   â†“
3. User clicks "Open Authentication Page"
   â†“
4. New tab opens: https://shopscout-auth.fly.dev
   â†“
5. User signs in with Google (or email/magic link)
   â†“
6. Auth page sends user data to auth server (/auth-success)
   â†“
7. Background script polls /check-auth every 2 seconds
   â†“
8. Background script receives user data
   â†“
9. User data stored in chrome.storage.local
   â†“
10. Sidebar polls chrome.storage.local every 2 seconds
   â†“
11. Sidebar detects authentication
   â†“
12. Sidebar shows user profile and is ready to use!
```

## Files Modified

1. âœ… `/auth-server/public/auth.js` - Fixed backend URL
2. âœ… `/auth-server/server.js` - Improved auth data persistence
3. âœ… `/background.js` - Enhanced polling and logging
4. âœ… `/src/App.tsx` - Better auth detection

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Deploy (Recommended)

```bash
# Make script executable (already done)
chmod +x deploy-auth-fix.sh

# Run deployment script
./deploy-auth-fix.sh

# Build extension
npm run build

# Load extension from 'dist' folder in Chrome
```

### Manual Deploy

```bash
# Deploy auth server
cd auth-server
fly deploy
cd ..

# Build extension
npm run build

# Load extension:
# 1. Go to chrome://extensions/
# 2. Enable Developer mode
# 3. Remove old extension
# 4. Click "Load unpacked"
# 5. Select the 'dist' folder
```

## Testing the Fix

### 1. Test Authentication
```bash
# Open Chrome DevTools on extension background (chrome://extensions/)
# Click "service worker" link under ShopScout
# You should see these logs after signing in:

[ShopScout] ðŸŽ‰ Authentication detected from web page!
[ShopScout] User: your-email@example.com
[ShopScout] âœ… User data stored successfully
```

### 2. Test Sidebar
```bash
# Right-click sidebar and select "Inspect"
# You should see:

[ShopScout Sidebar] Starting authentication check...
[ShopScout Sidebar] âœ… User authenticated: your-email@example.com
```

### 3. Verify Storage
```javascript
// In background service worker console:
chrome.storage.local.get(null, (data) => console.log(data));

// Should show:
{
  authenticated: true,
  userId: "...",
  userEmail: "your-email@example.com",
  displayName: "Your Name",
  ...
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix

âœ… **Sign In Flow**:
- Click extension icon â†’ Sidebar opens
- Click "Open Authentication Page" â†’ Auth page opens
- Sign in with Google â†’ Success message appears
- Auth tab closes automatically (or can be closed manually)
- Sidebar updates within 2-4 seconds showing your profile

âœ… **Persistent Authentication**:
- Authentication persists across browser restarts
- No need to sign in again unless you sign out
- User profile shows in sidebar header

âœ… **Product Analysis**:
- Navigate to Amazon, eBay, Walmart, etc.
- Click extension icon
- Sidebar analyzes product and shows deals
- All features work as expected

## Troubleshooting

### Sidebar Still Shows "Authentication Required"

**Check 1: Verify Auth Server Deployment**
```bash
cd auth-server
fly status
fly logs
```

**Check 2: Check Browser Console**
Look for error messages in:
- Extension background console (chrome://extensions/ â†’ service worker)
- Sidebar console (right-click sidebar â†’ Inspect)
- Auth page console (F12 on auth page)

**Check 3: Clear Storage and Retry**
```javascript
// In background service worker console:
chrome.storage.local.clear();
// Then re-authenticate
```

### Auth Tab Doesn't Close Automatically

This is normal if the sidebar can't be opened automatically due to Chrome's user gesture requirements. The authentication is still successful:
1. Manually close the auth tab
2. Click the extension icon
3. Sidebar should now show your profile

### CORS Errors

If you see CORS errors:
1. Verify auth server is running: `fly status`
2. Check manifest.json has proper host_permissions
3. Redeploy auth server: `fly deploy`

## Key Improvements

1. âœ… **Production-Ready**: All URLs now use production endpoints
2. âœ… **Reliable Syncing**: Auth data persists long enough for extension to pick it up
3. âœ… **Better Debugging**: Comprehensive logging throughout the flow
4. âœ… **Robust Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks and error messages
5. âœ… **User-Friendly**: Clear feedback and automatic sidebar updates

## Production URLs

- **Auth Server**: https://shopscout-auth.fly.dev
- **Backend API**: https://shopscout-api.fly.dev
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL

## Support

If issues persist after following this guide:

1. Check all three consoles for error messages
2. Verify Fly.io deployments are healthy
3. Test the auth flow step by step
4. Check network tab for failed requests
5. Verify Firebase configuration is correct

## Success Criteria

âœ… User can sign in via auth page
âœ… Sidebar detects authentication within 2-4 seconds
âœ… User profile appears in sidebar header
âœ… Authentication persists across sessions
âœ… Extension works on product pages
âœ… No console errors during auth flow
