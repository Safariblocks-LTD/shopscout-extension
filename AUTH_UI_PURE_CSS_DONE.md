# ✅ AUTH UI RESTORED - PURE CSS

## Problem Solved

Chrome Manifest V3 blocks external script CDNs like Tailwind. The CSP error was:
```
'content_security_policy.extension_pages': Insecure CSP value "https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"
```

## Solution Applied

Replaced all Tailwind CDN with **pure inline CSS**:
- ❌ Removed: `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>`
- ✅ Added: Complete inline CSS with all styles
- ✅ Removed: CSP config from manifest (not needed)
- ✅ Result: Beautiful, fully styled auth page

## What's Included

The auth page now has pure CSS for:
- ✅ Gradient backgrounds
- ✅ Smooth animations (fade-in, spinner)
- ✅ Professional typography
- ✅ Styled buttons with hover effects
- ✅ Google sign-in button with logo
- ✅ Form inputs with focus states
