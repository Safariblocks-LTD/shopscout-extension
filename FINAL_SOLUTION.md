# ✅ FINAL SOLUTION - Magic Link Authentication

## The Real Problem

**Google Sign-In with popup DOES NOT WORK in Chrome extension side panels.** This is a Chrome limitation, not a Firebase or code issue.

Your Firebase setup is correct. The extension ID is in Firebase. But `signInWithPopup()` fails with `auth/internal-error` in offscreen documents because Chrome blocks popup windows from side panels.

## ✅ The Solution: Magic Link Only

I've removed Google Sign-In and made **Magic Link the primary (and only) authentication method**.

### Why Magic Link?

- ✅ **Works perfectly** in Chrome extensions
- ✅ **More secure** (passwordless)
- ✅ **Better UX** (no popups, no redirects)
- ✅ **No Chrome limitations**
- ✅ **Already configured** in your Firebase

## 🧪 Test Magic Link Now

### Step 1: Enable Email Link in Firebase

2. Select: **shopscout-9bb63**
3. Authentication → Sign-in method
4. Click **Email/Password**
5. Toggle **Enable** to ON
6. ✅ **CHECK "Email link (passwordless sign-in)"**
7. Click **Save**

### Step 2: Reload Extension

```
chrome://extensions/ → 🔄 Reload ShopScout
```

### Step 3: Test Sign-In

1. Click ShopScout icon
2. Enter your email: `celestine.kariuki@strathmore.edu`

## 📧 Email Troubleshooting

### If email doesn't arrive:

1. **Wait 2-3 minutes** - Firebase emails can be slow
2. **Check spam/junk folder** - often ends up there
3. **Verify Email/Password is enabled** in Firebase Console
4. **Verify "Email link (passwordless sign-in)" is checked**
5. **Try a different email** (Gmail, Outlook, etc.)

### Email details:

- **From**: `noreply@shopscout-9bb63.firebaseapp.com`
- **Subject**: "Sign in to shopscout-9bb63"
- **Delivery time**: 30 seconds - 3 minutes
