## 🚀 DEPLOY BACKEND NOW

The backend code is fixed but needs to be redeployed:

```bash
cd /home/kcelestinomaria/startuprojects/shopscout/server

# Option 1: Use the deploy script
./DEPLOY_NOW.sh

# Option 2: Manual deployment
flyctl deploy --ha=false
```

---

## 🧪 After Deployment - Test

### 1. Test API Endpoint:
```bash
curl "https://shopscout-api.fly.dev/api/search?query=samsung+tablet"
```

**Expected response:**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "results": [
    {
      "title": "Samsung Galaxy Tab...",
      "price": 299.99,
      "source": "Amazon",
      "url": "https://..."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 2. Reload Extension:
1. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Click reload on ShopScout
3. Go to Amazon product page
4. Click "Scan This Product Page"

### 3. Expected Results:
- ✅ Product details (accurate rating: 4.1)
- ✅ **Price Comparison section with deals from other stores**
- ✅ Trust score
- ✅ Refresh button working
- ✅ No "No deals found" message

---

## 📊 What Changed in Backend

**File:** `/server/index.js` (line 408)

**Before:**
```javascript
res.json({
  results: topDeals,
  allResults: combinedResults.slice(0, 20),
  bestDeal,
  // Missing success field!
});
```

**After:**
```javascript
res.json({
  success: true, // ✅ CRITICAL FIX
  results: topDeals,
  allResults: combinedResults.slice(0, 20),
  bestDeal,
  // ... rest of response
});
```

**Why this matters:**
The extension checks for `data.success === true` before showing deals. Without this field, it shows "No deals found" even when the API returns valid results.
