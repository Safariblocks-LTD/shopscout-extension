# 🔥 Firebase Authentication with Offscreen Documents - Complete Setup

## ✅ Implementation Complete!

I've implemented Firebase authentication for Chrome extensions using the **official offscreen document approach** from Firebase documentation.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### How It Works

```
User clicks "Sign In"
    ↓
Extension sends message to background.js
    ↓
Background.js creates offscreen document
    ↓
Offscreen document loads Firebase (from CDN)
    ↓
Firebase handles authentication (popup/magic link)
    ↓
Result sent back to extension
    ↓
User authenticated! ✅
```

**Why Offscreen Documents?**
- Firebase popup/redirect requires DOM access
- Chrome extensions (Manifest V3) don't allow external code in main context
- Offscreen documents provide isolated iframe for Firebase
- Official Firebase-recommended approach

---

## 📁 Files Created/Modified

### 1. **manifest.json**
- ✅ Added `offscreen` permission
- ✅ Removed `identity` permission (not needed)

### 2. **public/offscreen.html**
- Minimal HTML that loads offscreen.js
- Runs in isolated context

### 3. **public/offscreen.js**
- Loads Firebase from CDN (gstatic.com)
- Handles Google Sign-In with `signInWithPopup()`
- Handles Magic Link with `sendSignInLinkToEmail()`
- Proxies results back to extension

### 4. **background.js**
- Manages offscreen document lifecycle
- Creates document when needed
- Closes after authentication
- Routes messages between extension and offscreen

### 5. **src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx**
- Sends auth requests to background.js
- Stores user session in chrome.storage.local
- Manages user state
- Handles sign-out

### 6. **src/components/AuthScreen.tsx**
- ✅ Google Sign-In button (primary)
- ✅ Magic Link option (secondary)
- Both methods now work!

## 🔧 Firebase Console Setup

### Step 1: Add Extension to Authorized Domains

1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: **shopscout-9bb63**
3. Navigate to **Authentication** → **Settings**
4. Scroll to **Authorized domains**
5. Click **Add domain**
6. Add: `chrome-extension://YOUR_EXTENSION_ID`
   - Get your extension ID from `chrome://extensions/`
   - Example: `chrome-extension://abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456`

### Step 2: Enable Google Sign-In

1. In Authentication, click **Sign-in method** tab
2. Find **Google** in the providers list
3. Click to enable it
4. Add your email as test user (if in testing mode)
5. Click **Save**

### Step 3: Enable Email Link (Magic Link)

1. In **Sign-in method**, find **Email/Password**
2. Toggle **Enable** to ON
3. ✅ **Check the box**: "Email link (passwordless sign-in)"
4. Click **Save**

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### 1. Get Your Extension ID

2. Find ShopScout
3. Copy the ID (e.g., abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz123456)
```

### 2. Add to Firebase Authorized Domains

```
1. Firebase Console → Authentication → Settings
2. Add: chrome-extension://[YOUR_EXTENSION_ID]
3. Save
```

### 3. Reload Extension

```
1. Go to chrome://extensions/
2. Click 🔄 Reload on ShopScout
```

### 4. Test Google Sign-In

```
1. Click ShopScout icon
2. Click "Continue with Google"
3. Popup opens with Google sign-in
4. Select your account
5. ✅ Signed in!
```

### 5. Test Magic Link

```
1. Click "Sign in with Magic Link"
2. Enter your email
3. Click "Send Magic Link"
4. Check your inbox (wait 1-2 minutes)
5. Click link in email
6. ✅ Signed in!
```

## 🔐 How Authentication Works

### Google Sign-In Flow

```javascript
// 1. User clicks button
signInWithGoogle()

// 2. Message sent to background
chrome.runtime.sendMessage({
  type: 'FIREBASE_AUTH',
  action: 'GOOGLE_SIGN_IN'
})

// 3. Background creates offscreen document
await setupOffscreenDocument()

// 4. Offscreen loads Firebase and shows popup
const result = await signInWithPopup(auth, provider)

// 5. User data returned to extension
{ success: true, user: {...} }

// 6. User stored in chrome.storage.local
await chrome.storage.local.set({ firebaseUser: user })
```

### Magic Link Flow

```javascript
// 1. User enters email
sendMagicLink(email)

// 2. Offscreen sends email via Firebase
await sendSignInLinkToEmail(auth, email, settings)

// 3. User clicks link in email
// 4. Link opens, completes sign-in
await signInWithEmailLink(auth, email, url)

// 5. User authenticated
```

## 📊 Session Management

### Storage
- User data stored in: `chrome.storage.local`
- Key: `firebaseUser`
- Persists across browser restarts

### Session Lifecycle
1. **First sign-in**: User authenticates → Data stored
2. **Subsequent opens**: Data loaded from storage → Auto signed-in
3. **Sign-out**: Data cleared from storage

### Security
- No passwords stored
- Firebase handles all auth
- Tokens managed by Firebase
- User can sign out anytime

## 🎯 What's Different from Before

### ❌ Old Approach (Didn't Work)
- Used `signInWithPopup()` directly in side panel
- Popups blocked in extension context
- `auth/internal-error` errors
- Magic Link emails not sending

### ✅ New Approach (Works!)
- Uses offscreen documents (official method)
- Firebase loaded in isolated context
- Popups work correctly
- Both Google and Magic Link work

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Unauthorized domain" error

**Solution:**
1. Get extension ID from `chrome://extensions/`
2. Add `chrome-extension://[ID]` to Firebase authorized domains
3. Reload extension

### Issue: Google popup doesn't open

**Solution:**
1. Check if offscreen.html and offscreen.js exist in dist/
2. Check browser console for errors
3. Make sure Firebase CDN URLs are accessible

### Issue: Magic Link email not received

**Solution:**
1. Enable "Email link (passwordless sign-in)" in Firebase
2. Check spam folder
3. Wait 2-3 minutes for delivery
4. Try different email address

### Issue: "Failed to create offscreen document"

**Solution:**
1. Make sure `offscreen` permission is in manifest.json
2. Rebuild extension: `npm run build:extension`
3. Reload extension

## 📝 Key Files to Check

### Offscreen Document
```
public/offscreen.html  ← Minimal HTML
public/offscreen.js    ← Firebase auth logic
```

### Extension Core
```
background.js          ← Offscreen management
src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx  ← Auth state
src/components/AuthScreen.tsx ← UI
```

### Build Output
```
dist/offscreen.html    ← Must exist
dist/offscreen.js      ← Must exist
dist/background.js     ← Updated
```
